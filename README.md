# I'm Asianguy_123, student in the UK
I'm using GitHub as online storage for my projects, and hopefully to meet and contribute to interesting people's projects

# Interests

- Python: script writing, game dev, looking into discord bot development
- Web Development using HTML, CSS and currently ***very little*** JavaScript
- Basic C# and .NET development

# Plans and Ongoing Projects

Currently I am designing and creating a portfolio website frontend, as well as planning to make another retro game in Python.

In the future I would like to delve deeper into bot development with discord.py or discord,js (most likely the former), and into web backend and databasing using Python.

Additionally I intend to become more proficient at C# development and software development that has more practical uses than a basic password tester. 

Rust is also a possible avenue I may want to go down, having heard great things about it.
